<ul>
    <li>The "What's Cookin" project is a website that uses hosted datasets to allow a randomized user to scroll through a list of recipes and "Favorite" them, add them to a list of "Recipes to cook", review their ingredients and instructions, or search recipes by names and tags</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Bret - I greatly appriciated my team! Chris and Ian and I really meshed well, and they both would bring new elements to the project that they'd worked on in their own time. They also really showed me how to have good Github workflow, especially when it came to commenting on pull requests.</li>
    <li>Ian - Working with and learning from Bret and Chris. We collaborated well and had a great symbiotic relationship throughout the project.</li>
    <li>Chris - Working with Bret and Ian was awesome. They both had knowledge that I didn't have and we all really came together well to get the project completed.</li>
</ul>
